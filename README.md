🔐 OpenSSL File Encryption Demo (AES-256-CBC)This document demonstrates the execution of a simple symmetric encryption and decryption process using the openssl command-line utility on Kali Linux.The goal is to encrypt a file (note.txt) using the powerful AES-256-CBC cipher and then decrypt it to recover the original message.PrerequisitesKali Linux operating system.openssl package installed (standard on Kali).1. Ready-to-Run Commands (Copy & Paste)Use these blocks to quickly execute the demo in your terminal. You will be prompted for a password for encryption and decryption.1.1. Create Plaintextecho "Top Secret: The flag is 'K4l1_R0x_47'" > note.txt cat note.txt 1.2. Encrypt File# Encrypts note.txt into note.enc (will prompt for password) openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -pbkdf2 -in note.txt -out note.enc cat note.enc 1.3. Decrypt File# Decrypts note.enc into recovered.txt (will prompt for the same password) openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -salt -pbkdf2 -in note.enc -out recovered.txt cat recovered.txt 2. Command Execution WalkthroughThis section provides a detailed trace of the commands and the expected output you experienced, demonstrating how the data changes state.Step 1: Create the Plaintext FileA file named note.txt is created with the secret message and verified.$echo "Top Secret: The flag is 'K4l1_R0x_47'" > note.txt$ cat note.txt Top Secret: The flag is 'K4l1_R0x_47' Step 2: Encrypt the File (Plaintext to Ciphertext)The openssl enc command converts the readable note.txt into the unreadable ciphertext, note.enc.-aes-256-cbc: Sets the symmetric cipher for strong encryption.-salt & -pbkdf2: These flags ensure a robust, salted key derivation, making the password-based encryption much more secure against brute-force attacks.$ openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -pbkdf2 -in note.txt -out note.enc enter AES-256-CBC encryption password: Verifying - enter AES-256-CBC encryption password:

$ cat note.enc Salted__lIkr4$Kک^7-4xX# 1LNW[ѵ Observation: The output of cat note.enc begins with Salted_, followed by non-printable, obfuscated data, confirming successful encryption.Step 3: Decrypt the File (Ciphertext to Plaintext)The critical -d flag is added to reverse the process. The same cipher, salt, and PBKDF2 function are used to regenerate the key required for decryption.$ openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -salt -pbkdf2 -in note.enc -out recovered.txt enter AES-256-CBC decryption password:

$ cat recovered.txt Top Secret: The flag is 'K4l1_R0x_47' Result: The original message is recovered successfully, demonstrating the core principle of symmetric encryption.
